# ⭐ Unicafe Feedback App – Step 6

This project is part of the **Full Stack Open 2024** course (University of Helsinki).  
The goal is to build a simple feedback system in React that collects user opinions and displays statistics dynamically.

## 📚 Description

Users can provide feedback by selecting **good**, **neutral**, or **bad**.  
The app calculates and displays:

- Total number of feedbacks
- Average score
- Positive feedback percentage

If no feedback has been given, the app shows a message instead of statistics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (functional components, props, state)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vite / Create React App** (depending on setup)

## 🚀 Features

✅ Collect feedback: good / neutral / bad  
✅ Real-time statistics update without refreshing  
✅ Conditional rendering (show message if no feedback given)  
✅ Separate reusable components for clarity  
✅ Clean, minimal UI
