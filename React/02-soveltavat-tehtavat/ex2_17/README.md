# 📞 Phonebook App – Step 12

This project is part of the **Full Stack Open 2024** course (University of Helsinki).  
The goal is to build a full-stack phonebook application. Users can view, add, and delete contacts, with data stored on a server.

## 📚 Description

The app allows users to:

- View a list of persons with names and phone numbers
- Add new contacts through a form
- Delete existing contacts
- Receive notifications for successful operations or errors (e.g., duplicate name, network errors)

The application interacts with a backend server via REST API and updates the frontend in real-time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend:** JSON-server
- **Database:** JSON file
- **HTTP Client:** Axios for API requests

## 🚀 Features

✅ Display a list of all contacts  
✅ Add new contact with validation (no duplicates allowed)  
✅ Delete contacts from the phonebook  
✅ Search/filter contacts dynamically by name  
✅ Notifications for actions (success/error)  
✅ Frontend-backend integration with REST API

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Connect React frontend to a backend API

- Manage state with React hooks (useState, useEffect)

- Implement CRUD operations via RESTful endpoints

- Handle notifications and validation errors
