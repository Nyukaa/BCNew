## 🔧 Problem Solving / Challenges

While deploying my site from local to hosting, I faced a few challenges:

- **Media files** were not saving smoothly and had to be re-uploaded manually.
- **Plugins** needed to be installed and configured again on the hosting server.
- Ensuring that **all pages and theme features** worked correctly after migration required careful checking.

Despite these challenges, I successfully deployed the site, and it is now fully available online. I am satisfied with the result and learned a lot about **WordPress deployment and troubleshooting**.
