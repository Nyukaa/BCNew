# 👩‍💻 Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to [my portfolio](https://nyukaa.github.io/BCNew/Portfolio/index.html)! 

This website was designed and built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to showcase my projects, skills, and personal style.  
The site is **fully responsive**, **visually engaging**, and provides a **smooth user experience** across different devices.

📸 **AI-Enhanced Image**  
The hero image used on the site was generated with **ChatGPT**, based on an original photo of me. The image was stylistically adjusted to better support the visual identity of the portfolio.
